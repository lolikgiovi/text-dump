[Music] it hadn't been long since Nate became the manager at the office but he immediately decided to break the way of things there the first thing he did was cut the salaries of course bypassing his own as greedy as he was he cut the salaries of almost all of the staff many submitted their resignation letters almost the same day those who remained didn't mind quitting either but the lack of other immediate options forced him to endure the antics of the tyrant almost half of the staff was now gone nit explained that some of the positions were useless and repetitive those who stayed ended up getting twice as much workload as a result they had to stay up late sometimes his Antics reached even the janitor lady who wasn't getting paid much to begin with so even she quit her job so the biggest problem was finding a replacement for her for pennies no one wanted to mop the floors all day and rubbed the door handles till they shine the HR manager Mrs Bennett tried every day to convince Nate to add at least a little to the salary of the janitor saying that for that kind of pay they would never find an employee so every morning during the staff meeting all Nate did was complain how dirty and dusty was in the whole office office was indeed getting pretty Dirty by this time it was during one of these morning meetings when Nate complained about every single thing that was going on in the office everybody was dumbfounded because this branch of the company was functioning perfectly fine after going over the weekly reports Nate turned his attention to the problem of the janitor position if you don't find a janitor soon I'll have to include cleaning in your direct duties he almost shouted to the HR manager she was ready to run anywhere from this freak of a saver but she knew that at her age it was not so easy to find a job therefore every time Nate brought this up she she just silently listened to his unreasonable approaches and demands washing it all down later in her office with anti-anxiety pills at the next such morning meeting the manager once again expressed his dissatisfaction with Mrs Bennis work saying that the janitor had still not been found is it really that difficult to find a cleaner I mean we're so successful that anybody would be willing to work in a stable company Nate said angrily slowly approaching the window at some point he silently froze and just stayed there staring out the window his gaze seemed to focus on something in the distance at the garbage cans a very poorly dressed woman was neatly stacking cardboard boxes Nate started smiling slyily he turned to Mrs Bennett and said so you're saying no one wants to join our company for that pay huh watch and learn rookies he opened the window wide since it was pretty warm outside hey come in for a minute I got an offer you might want to hear Nate shout it but the girl did not stop her work even for a second and just continued to follow the cardboards the boss was surprised but he was not going to back down there was even some excitement in his eyes hey you need some cash get over here he shouted again but the girl kept working that irritated the boss a little and he turned to Mrs Bennett to get him the security guard when the security guard came running in the conference room Nate told him get that bomb by The Dump over here a sap he said to the guy in the uniform a few minutes later the girl entered the office after a few failed attempts to speak with her it became clear that she was completely deaf she seemed to have a hearing aid but apparently it wasn't working properly or it was just a cheap one the beggar looked about 30 years old surprisingly up close she was a very neat girl her hands were clean as were clothes and hair the absence of makeup made her face even younger and lighter her hair was neatly calmed and collected in a bun her clothes looked poor but clean although the size of her clothes didn't really fit her at least it didn't smell the boss apparently remembering that the deaf people can read lips began pronouncing each syllable slowly do you understand what I am saying the girl nodded do you want a job you do not have to do much you'll be just cleaning the office finish the boss the girl stood there silently for a couple of minutes looking around then she nodded an agreement which made Nate rise in Victory he was so proud of himself he turned to Mrs Bennett who was quietly watching what was happening can't find a cleaning lady perhaps you just forgot how to hire people well here's a lesson for you that worthless piece of crap was ready even for a smaller salary by the way before you announce it to her think about cutting it down a little bit maybe but when he saw Mrs Bennett's look he realized he was pushing it down too much and even the Homeless girl would run away for that kind of pain so he dropped the idea the deaf girl started working her name was Lauren and she always came to the office on time sometimes even long before they started a working day she diligently washed cleaned and wiped everything that she came across in just a week the office was unrecognizable but that did not improve the team's attitude towards the deaf colleague who was often the target of cruel and teasing jokes the colleagues would make fun of her behind her back and laugh so hard knowing that she couldn't
hear them the girl's hearing aid was of low quality and old yet she could still hear some of the nasty things people told about her and her work despite the constant harassment she had been through a lot in life and was able to maintain her composure she always looked forward to leaving work and returning to her peaceful home on the outskirts of the town where she lived in an old and abandoned Shack Lauren was not alone in her small home she had taken in several stray pets including three kittens a cat two dogs and a parrot with a broken paw these animals were her constant Companions and she was willing to endure the teasing and ridicule at work in order to provide for them her pets were her source of comfort and love and their presence helped her to cope with the daily abuse at work at night while she may have only bred and watered for herself she would always make sure to have something delicious for her furry friends as their loving glasses were enough to make up for A Hard Day's Work Mrs Bennett was extremely pleased with the cleaning lady whose work kept the office spotless despite the fact that her colleagues continued to mock her behind her back and the manager Nate he still remained unimpressed with her work he couldn't quite put his finger on what he wanted from her but over time the girl's silent demeanor and intelligent eyes began to earn her the respect of her colleagues even those who had previously made fun of Lauren began to realize that her past was not as simple as they thought despite being a beggar she was well spoken and literate Her speech was brief but insightful her colleagues were often taken aback by her clever and thought-provoking remarks giving the impression that she had a deep understanding of many things but just chose not to reveal it it became clear to them that her current situation was not a reflection of her intelligence or abilities the office atmosphere had become tense and stressful with Nate the boss displaying aggressive behavior every morning during the meetings it seemed to blame others for the company's poor performance which had begun to decline dramatically as a result of this decline the boss who had become increasingly bitter began to let go of employees on a regular basis often firing multiple people at once this only added to the negative atmosphere and uncertainty among the remaining employees rumors were circulating among the co-workers that Nate the boss would soon be the only one left in the office the company's owner and CEO Nolan had begun visiting more frequently likely due to the Branch's sudden decline in profits however Nate would use this as an opportunity to intimidate and pressure the employees to create a positive image for Nolan during his visits despite Nate's efforts Nolan who had built the company from the ground up was not going to let it fail and would take action to turn things around after several visits to what was once one of his successful branches Nolan noticed that while the office appeared to be functioning well on the surface there was a sense of unease among the employees after another visit Nolan announced that the company was undergoing a thorough cleaning process and that all employees including the manager would be given a paid day off anyone who refused would still be paid while everyone was away Nolan had installed hidden cameras throughout the office which were connected to his personal computer he wanted to uncover the truth about what was really happening in the office and take action to salvage the business he had built through hard work Nolan dedicated himself to monitoring the office every day from the time it opened until it closed he meticulously gathered information and evidence to understand the reasons behind the Branch's decline one day during a meeting Nolan was presented with a well-crafted business development plan that cut him off guard he quickly read through the material and looked up at Nate and surprise what is this Nolan asked Nate holding up the business plan who prepared it Nate realized that Nolan was intrigued by the material and modestly lowered his case replying I worked very hard on it sir I didn't sleep for several nights I really hope you like it the first thing that struck Nolan as odd was the neat feminine handwriting he had read multiple reports written by Nick so he was familiar with his scrawled handwriting his further investigation gave him more clues that Nate's mind was as convoluted and erratic as his handwriting Nolan viewed the recorded videos and was shocked to discover that the cleaning lady had spent a significant amount of time working on the papers late into the night she was completely focused and engrossed in her work not even keeping track of the time she was also able to create graphs and diagrams so easily as if she had been doing it for years Nolan was upset that he overlooked so many things at his branch the next morning Nate was summoned to Nolan's office he came rushing in but as soon as he saw the expression on Nolan's face he suddenly stopped he stood there looking down on the ground as Nolan scolded him everyone in the office was too afraid to speak or move fearing the boss's Wrath do you realize that your deceit and deception nearly destroyed the branch Nolan started furiously I am just astounded at the number of high-class employees I've lost due to your arrogant Behavior you fired all of the best workers that I've been working hard to hand pick for so long and Nolan I uh uh let me explain I don't need your explanation I was like okay uh I guess Nate's probably testing some kind of technique but
when you attempted to take credit for someone else's work that was the last straw Nolan calm down side and said you have 10 minutes to get your stuff and leave the once confident manager suddenly appeared defeated and lost color in his face as he made his way towards the exit at that moment he heard Nolan asked his secretary to bring in the cleaning lady a young woman named Lauren who was deaf as soon as Lauren silently entered the office Nolan gestured for her to sit down please take a seat I want to know more about you obviously you're intelligent and have not been disadvantaged all your life Nolan began the conversation the girl a bit confused confirmed that this was the case as she started speaking Nolan realized that despite her deafness she was not dim with it she looked out the window as she spoke softly and began to share her story Lauren grew up in a very poor family but from a young age she had a love for learning new things despite the difficult circumstances of her household where her parents would drink heavily and engage in drunken fights at night she worked hard on her studies from the third grade until she graduated she would seek refuge in an abandoned house near her apartment and would study there on the days her parents were drinking in the morning she would slip back home quietly to grab her clothes in the backpack while her family was still asleep and would rush to school despite the challenging circumstances Lauren managed to excel in her studies and had no difficulties getting accepted into a business school she was a smart and determined student who was well liked by all her teachers she had a natural ability to understand Concepts so quickly and was always willing to assist her classmates it came as no surprise to anyone that Lauren graduated with the highest GPA business administration was her favorite subject and her lifelong aspiration it was there where she first met her first love Connor who was a year older as soon as they saw each other in the University's East hallway they knew they had fallen in love however Conor's wealthy family disapproved of their relationship particularly the idea of their son marrying a smart but financially challenged woman despite this their love was so strong that Conor proposed to Lauren expressing that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her Lauren and her fiance Connor went to visit her friends outside the city one day they were in High Spirits especially since they were due to get married in the week they were getting close to their friend's country house where everyone was already waiting for them when a dense fog descended suddenly everything around them was white and hazy they didn't even realize when the headlights of an oncoming car Shone right into their windshield terrible Screech of ranks a crash when Lauren regained Consciousness she was already in an ambulance the first thing Lauren asked about was her fiance's well-being She fainted upon learning that he had passed away when she woke up in the hospital room Lauren immediately realized that something had changed in her life from that moment on she became deaf the doctors were unable to explain the sudden loss of hearing and attributed it to stress despite her hearing loss and difficult mental state she pleaded with the doctors to allow her to attend her Lover's funeral but she was denied even the chance to visit his grave Conor's parents blamed her for the accident and claimed that if it weren't for her and her broke friends she wouldn't have gone to the Country House in the end almost launching at her with her fists Connor's mother literally hissed I will make her life miserable you can only get a job as a janitor at best you will cry regretting that you ruined my son the only thing that the poor girl regretted at that moment was that she didn't die instead of Connor after all no one needed her anyway her mom changed roommates like gloves and soon managed to burn down their house when she was having drinking sprees with another one of them her life was full of nose no job no home no love and now no hearing it was impossible to get a job no one was interested in a deaf fragile beggar in the beginning she taught herself how to read lips after some time she managed to earn a bit of extra money by cleaning at the local market she spent that money on a cheap hearing aid it didn't restore her hearing completely but it allowed her to hear some words from then on she started to just wander around she found a small shed where she could take shelter despite her difficult circumstances she never complained about her life because she had already seen so much unfairness she was content with her beloved pets who were her closest companions the only problem was that when the weather turned cold her pets would freeze since the room in the abandoned house was not heated even at that moment she was worried about her Pet's well-being Nolan sat there quietly listening to her sad story at the end of the story she remembered the tragic accident involving Conor he knew his Rich parents and was saddened by what happened that same day he offered Lauren a highly qualified business graduate to become the new executive director of the branch and when she agreed he was very satisfied with the decision the branch improved rapidly Nolan visited the branch frequently sometimes he was even seen picking up Lauren from work at some point everyone knew they were dating and eventually the news of their marriage became known to everyone Noland made her a perfect gift one day he
dropped by the branch after lunch he knocked on Laura's office and when he entered he saw that she was all consumed as usual honey take a break will ya I got you something in his hands was a certificate making her the owner of an animal shelter where all her pets were residing as she settled into her new home with her husband she would not have the time to take care of them in the foreseeable future on top of everything she was excitedly preparing for the arrival of a baby boy when Nolan heard the news he was overjoyed there's one more miracle that happened in Lauren's life that even doctors couldn't explain her hearing suddenly returned as if it was never gone making her fully functional the large and spacious House of the businessman was now filled with the warmth and comfort of a home what are your thoughts on the story and characters how would you handle things differently share your thoughts as they may be helpful for those experiencing difficult times if you enjoyed this story please consider liking and subscribing for more content click the notification Bell button thank you and we'll see you soon
