Title: Husband leaves on vacation alone, not wanting to wait for his wife...a week later he returns to this

today Janice found herself in an unusually buoyant mood the reason being she was just days away from her long-anticipated break it was her final week at work and the prospect of an upcoming vacation fueled her excitement after officially completing her work duties she made her way home completely unaware of the surprise that awaited her that evening she arrived home her spirits higher than usual spotting her husband's packed suitcase in the hallway brought a delighted smile to her face she assumed he had taken the initiative to pack for their vacation Sean her husband was never particularly good at packing yet this time he had not only managed to do it himself but also found the travel pillow something she found most amusing and endearing Sean my love I'm back Janice surefully announced that she entered the kitchen but her happiness abruptly faded upon seeing the sight before her Sean was seated at the kitchen table a glass of wine in hand he was dressed not in his usual casual home attire but as if he was ready to leave the house sweetheart what's happening are you heading out she asked her confusion the parent Janice I'm weary Sean began his tune somber I need to go now I need some time to unwind to rest I'm afraid I might be depressed Janice stared at her husband bewilderment cladding her eyes darling what do you mean can't you wait just one more week Janice was at a loss unable to comprehend the sudden shift in her husband's mood you wouldn't understand Janice he replied thirstly you're always cheerful at work surrounded by her supportive team meanwhile I'm here feeling low and in desperate need of a break her eyes then fell on a bang Steam and lying on the table to her dismay was clear that Sean had transferred the money they had painstakingly safe together into his personal account holding the statement she said Sean what depression are you referring to we've been saving this money for our shared vacation for our trip to the Bahamas I've been eagerly waiting for this day and now you're asking me to delay it because your work won't permit you a vacation Sean retorted his voice beginning to show her irritation Janice could feel her anger Brewing I never said my work wouldn't grant me a vacation she fired back in fact I agreed with them today that this is my last week besides we never set a specific date for our trip why would you plan your leave now when I can't join you're not being rational today Janice you rebuked her I told you I'm exhausted I've had enough of the dreary cold weather I need a change somewhere warm somewhere peaceful and what about me she demanded feeling neglected her husband merely Shrugged in response well practically speaking you can't come along you're tied up with work I don't understand why we're arguing about this I'm the head of the family and I get to decide what's best for us Sean's Bros furrowed his anger visible she watched and pack the rest of his belongings this wasn't some ill-conceived chest he was serious about leaving alone without her but Sean that's not not fair she protested we saved that money together if you can't wait for me at least you should only take your share whilst I get my leave I'll join you or go somewhere else using my portion Sean paused and looked at her his face devoid of empathy what do you want Janice do you want me to stay and have a mental breakdown how am I supposed to divide the money what if I run out how about this if there's anything left I'll bring it back and Janice I have a huge favor to ask don't ruin my mood before the trip I've mentally already embarked on this journey in fact I've booked my flight for tonight Janus was rendered speechless by his audacity by the fact that he had already booked his ticket for that very evening words seemed to elude her Pang of hurt constricted her throat and she retreated to her room to avoid witnessing her husband's departure she had sent something amiss lately had been acting out of character coming home late initiating uncharacteristic lengthy conversations she just couldn't put her finger on why his behavior had suddenly altered Janice had initially tucked away such troubling thoughts the fear of confronting them was too daunting she didn't want to dwell on suspicions that might turn out to be baseless instead she decided to call me assess the situation could it be that she was overreacting maybe it wasn't so unusual for a married couple to take separate vacations occasionally but then the resounding slam of the front door caused Janice to startle did he just leave without even saying goodbye that can be happening she pondered she stepped out of the room only to be greedy by the harsh reality that it indeed could happen just as she was on the brink of Tears something on the table caught her eye Sean had left his phone behind he had a password she didn't know but an incoming message briefly lit up the screen providing her enough time to read it I'm already at the airport waiting for you babe give me a call when you get there before she could process the message the front door creaked open and Sean re-entered he eyed Janice suspiciously grabbed his phone then planted a quick kiss on her cheek I've got a dash love don't worry about a thing Janice was momentarily Frozen then swiftly dressed and bolted out the door frantically waving for a taxi the ride to the airport was the longest most excruciating Journey she'd ever taken she didn't know where to look for him but unfortunately they were immediately noticeable their behavior reminiscent of smitten High

School sweethearts the woman was considerably younger than her a gasp escaped Janice as she covered her mouth with her hand watching them from a distance so this was it five years of married life five years of believing we were a happy family she mused Janice and Sean's story had begun in College Sean was late for an English class he was the last one to enter and there was only one vacant seat by a stroke of Fate that seat was right next to a very beautiful girl Janice Janice was a radiant Beauty so stunning that many guys felt too intimidated to approach her this lack of attention paradoxically dented janus's self-confidence she started to believe something was amiss with her so when Sean ended up sitting next to her she was immediately intrigued by his apparent courage prashan however he saw no other choice he felt at ease sitting next to such an attractive girl not because he was overly confident but rather because he deemed himself invisible to her he believed that he didn't stand a chance so there was nothing to lose or be nervous about when a class discussion pair them up Sean found a reason to talk to her that's when he discovered that Janus was not just beautiful but also humble and friendly maybe that was when he realized he could sway Janice to his favor as time went on Sean grew more comfortable chatting with her even forgetting their perceived social Gap one day he offered her a ride home after class by the end of the semester they were officially dating after graduation they took the next step and got married but now their marital bliss had crumbled Sean was using their shirt savings to whisk his mistress away to the Bahamas while Janice would have to return to work the next day she would come home to an empty house waiting for her husband's return from his Escapade she felt utterly alone without anyone to confide in seek advice from or even just ventu Janus had grown up fatherless a boy that had always nodded her she never experienced a father's guidance love or protection a hollow feeling that left her feeling incomplete people told her that as she Grew Older she would overcome the absence and move on but the opposite happened the void magnified over time in retrospect she realized she tolerated so much of Sean's unacceptable Behavior because she had no model of how a man should treat her it'd pained her every time she mulled over this and now it hurt even more as she found herself stranded in her sorrow with no one to turn to Janice lost her mother at the tender age of 18. she had since been living with her aunt but she always felt like an outsider her aunt insisted that Janus received the same treatment as her own children but Janice knew otherwise she understood there was no substitute for her mother's love she managed to stick it out with her odds family until she could escape to college in the blossoming phase of their relationship living with Sean was nothing short of a paradise for her the world seemed brighter and their home was a cocoon of joy and love however as the leaves of time turned over she began to unravel a less pleasing facet of shock she realized he was more aware of her vulnerabilities than she had ever been and was subtly manipulating them for his own advantage Sean was employed part-time if actually was initially accepting of meanwhile she dutifully clocked in her full-time hours not begrudging him as seemingly easier schedule however she began to recognize an unspoken expectation falling heavily on her shoulders the household chores were her domain alone every single day she found herself knee-deep in Dirty Laundry battling with stubborn stains and ironing out wrinkled clothes her hands constantly prunes from washing the never-ending pile of dishes remnants of their meals serving as a constant reminder of her thankless job and cooking that was an entirely different ball game every night like a ritual she would be seen juggling pans and pots stirring a delicious meal for Sean who was ensconced in his own world despite all this she remained silent choosing to swallow her frustration rather than voice it oh well it's just one of those things she would often mutter to herself downplaying her growing resentment Sean on the other hand was oblivious to her mounting exhaustion he relished in the luxury of sleeping late the Sun High and bright before he would even stir from bed his days was often spent locked away in his computer room engrossed in his virtual world leaving her alone to manage the real one one evening while she was busy stirring the pot she called out Sean could you please give me a hand with setting the table Little Love Came the distant replied from the computer room as always she side dropping the subject just as she had done countless times before yet the silent plea for acknowledgment linger than the air marking the growing distance between them when Shaw's Father Robert fell seriously ill Sean implored Janice to move in with him expressing a dutiful desire to look after his ailing Father Robert was aging frail and evidently incapable of Vanishing himself alone but as Janus had anticipated she ended up shouldering the responsibilities of two men instead of one however Janice held no resentment toward Robert instead she embraced him as though he were her own father caring for him with patience and kindness Robert in turn grew exceptionally fond of Janus he noticed perhaps more acutely than she realized the imbalance in the way his son treated her one day he shared cryptic advice with her saying you my dear were never meant to settle his words puzzled her leaving a question in her mind

that would resurface later when Robert's Health improved he suggested they returned to their own home grateful for his recovery but exhausted from the additional caregiving a few months after they were settled tragedy struck Janice's family her arms succumbed to a heart attack although Janice felt a twitch of sadness that she wasn't treated with the same warmth her aunt showed her own daughters her heart still ached at the loss after all it was this woman who sheltered and fed her after her own Mother's untimely death deep down she harbored a profound love for her aunt three days into her morning Sean lost his temper at Janus she's dead Janice stop bringing her up and for God's sake stop crying he exploded Sean Janice retorted her voice wavering it's only been three days she hadn't even cried that much her grief was mostly silent carried in her heart rather than shown on her face yet Sean seemed to have little understanding or patience for her quiet sorrow now in the bustling airport Janna snapped back to reality for a routine of thoughts a part of her wanted to confront Sean to vent her anger on his mistress but it was too late they had vanished into the crowd while the airport bust with people rushing to catch their flights she stumbled out into the street Vision blurred with tears as she blindly bumped into passerby they deftly steered clear of her in her emotional Haze she took a turn into a quiet Alleyway and found the bench blanketed with snow she sat down and let her tears flow freely Janice lost track of time she was roused from her sobs by the biting cold in her emotional fog a blizzard had crept up on her she stood up dusted the snow off and robbed her Frost coated eyes her eyelashes were fluffy with ice crystals a side that might have been beautiful if she could have seen it as she started walking towards the exit of the alley she noticed a man hunched over on the curb his figure coated in snow her first thought thought was that he must be out of his mind to sit in his freezing weather she was too wrapped up in her own turmoil to concern herself with him as she walked past him a glimpse of his eyes empty and lost tugged at her heart strengths on impulse she turned back and walked over to him she rummished in her Pockets found some cash and extended it to him he looked up at her with his melancholic eyes he made no move to take the money just went back to staring blankly into the distance cut off guard Janice blurted excuse me sir might you need some assistance she'll receive no response she found herself questioning her actions what on Earth am I doing offering help to a stranger who won't even acknowledge me in a desperate attempt she suggested perhaps I could get you a warranty or something the faintest hint of a smile tug that the corners of the man's lips encouraged she didn't wait for an affirmation she stepped into a nearby cafe purchased a hot tea in the sandwich and brought them back to the man regardless of her own troubles aiding the man brought a comforting feeling of accomplishment it was as if she could momentarily set her worries aside she handed the man the steaming cup of tea in the sandwich he looked up at her this time his eyes reflected gratitude as she walked away their residual warmth in her heart made her feel slightly better she was hailing a taxi when she heard footsteps behind her she turned to find the man standing there I'm Sorry Miss I forgot to express my gratitude thank you for your kindness he said softly she responded with a faint smile it's no trouble at all we all face problems in life I hope you find your way out of yours thank you he replied turning around he slowly began to walk away as he did Janice noticed him shivering in the cold a sudden urge surged within her to extend further help wait she called out after him how about you come to my place you can warm up there and I can make you a hot meal the man looked taken aback are you sure I'm just a homeless man Janice Shrugged have you spotted any royalty here I guess not but it's unusual most people avoid me people are different that's all she concluded Janus waved down a taxi upon seeing her the driver wore a friendly smile and held the door open however his expression shifted to unease when Janus extended her hand to help the homeless man into the vehicle I can't believe it are you actually bringing him along he is not stepping foot in my car lady I'm sorry excuse me Janice replied taking it back I'm sorry but look at him he's clearly not clean and he is a strong loader I'm gonna have to cancel your ride who's going to cover the cleaning costs the driver retorted Janice angered by the driver's bleaking disrespect clenched her jaw reached into her purse and pulled out a wad of cash would this sway your opinion she asked handing him the money the driver took the money his fingers swiftly counting the bells once he recognized a generous amount a grin spread across his face all right then get in the Hefty amount Janice had handed the driver seemed to make him chatty he nattered on about the weather and right about the low fears he usually received once they reached their destination the driver sped away swiftly upon entering the worm house the homeless man let out A Satisfied sigh it's so cozy here the man said I'm going to heat up some food you're welcome to warm up

here or take a hot shower the bathroom has towels and the Rope you can use thank you I know I'm imposing but I'll gladly accept your offer things have been pretty tough particularly without a proper bath you admit it Janice questioned her sanity several times over after all she had invited an absolute stranger into her home she didn't even know his name and now this man was in her bathroom regardless of how many times she questioned her decision she couldn't find a logical explanation it was a spur of the moment Choice her life would never be the same from this day forward she was just putting the finishing touches on the table when the man emerged from the bathroom fresh and clean Janice gawked and surprised and finally remarked you look like a different person he chuckled in response Janice had managed to set the table in the meantime as Dylan the guest who had unexpectedly felt the chair usually occupied by Sean tasted the worm meal he complimented its flavors his words weren't just a passing comment but genuine praise about the deliciousness of the food and she listened to him and his head an epiphany it had been an eternity since she had received any form of appreciation Dylan a man who was still essentially a stranger to her display the Keen sense of observation he pointed out specific elements of the meal appreciating the subtle blending of spices and the perfect balance of flavors this simple Act of recognition so genuine and spontaneous stirred something within Janus it sent a ripple of excitement through her heart it was then that she realized how accustomed she had become to her labor of love being overlooked for so long she had toiled tirelessly without a word of thanks where morsel of gratitude but with just a few sincere words Dylan had managed to validate her efforts and for that she felt the worm glow of appreciation feeling a sense of comfort and Dylan's company Janice Found the courage to ask so what's your story as the words left her lips she saw a sudden shift in Dylan's demeanor his easy smile of halter and his eyes swelled up with unshed tears it was clear that revisiting his past was a real paint with star of ram just two short years ago Dylan's life was the picture of normality the kind most people he yearned for a loving wife a sweet little daughter and a cozy house in the suburbs painted a picture of perfect Thomas to City they had plans for a joyous family trip to celebrate their daughter's sixth birthday they'd all been looking forward to the little getaway but life had other plans as they drove on the rain-soaked mountain pass their car lost control skidded dangerously and plunged over the guard rail in that terrifying moment Dylan's world was shattered his wife and daughter the core of his existence were cruelly snatched away in the tragic accident it was a harsh Twist of fate that Dylan himself survived the crash physically unharmed but emotionally devastated as he shared a story the pain in his voice echoed in the Silence of the room Janice could feel the heart-wrenching sorrow etched into every word the anguish of losing his loved ones was more than Dylan could bear who was engulfed by a sea of guilt pinning the blame for their untimely deaths squarely on himself residing in the house once pulsing with life the merry laughter of his little girl the loving Whispers of his wife was now a torturous ordeal the walls echoed with their memories every corner a cruel reminder of his loss to numb the piercing pain and escape to his tormenting thoughts he thought Solace and the bitter Embrace of alcohol but the temporary Escape soon spiraled into a damaging habit as he retreated into a shell of self-condemnation he pushed away everyone who attempted to extend the helping hand friends family their efforts to pull him out of his despair meant with a brick wall of refusal pretty Dylan life had lost his luster its very essence Fading Into the Gloom of his grief is mounting addiction and the hollow echo of his family's laughter and his lonely House Began to take a toll on his professional light here received multiple warnings from his employers each one falling in deaf ears inevitably he was fired a few months later with his finances drained and debts mounting he was evicted from the home that had once been the center of his Universe his life once marked by love and laughter that succumbed to an unending spiral of despair finding sustenance became a daily battle for Dylan initially he resorted to forging from trash dumpsters an experience that left him grappling with feelings of degradation and despair however as he gradually learned the Robes of Street survival he discovered that there were some restaurants willing to lend a helping hand to the homeless establishments specializing in bread products such as bagels and sandwiches often has surplus food that they were willing to give away his guilt over the tragic loss of his family had initially led him to this destitute lifestyle however over time he began to see the damaging effects of homelessness the harsh realities of street life began to weigh heavily on him pulling him down into a cycle of Despair that seemed increasingly difficult to escape the lifestyle he had initially chosen as a form of self-punishment was now trapping him threatening to consume him entirely Janus listened to his tail with a heavy heart or empathy palpable she reassured him that he shouldn't bear the blame for the accident she implored them to understand that a life consumed by guilt wasn't worth living her words were Earnest full of compassion and wisdom as she painted a picture of promising future that awaited him if he could

only stop blaming himself and start putting his life back together throughout their conversation Janus maintained steady eye contact her eyes radiating warmth and understanding her kind smile never faltered offering him comfort and acceptance for Dylan who hadn't felt such warmth and kindness in two long years her generosity was overwhelming this encounter with a complete stranger who had not only let him in for a hot shower and a meal but had also offered them empathy and advice was a ray of Hope in his otherwise Bleak existence the spark of hope that Dylan felt was unlike anything he'd experienced in the past two years it spent so long aimlessly wandering living on the street tweets nursing his guilt and Steed in his sorrow he had almost forgotten what it felt like to have a purpose a goal a desire for a future that held more than just mere survival meeting Janice receiving her compassion and understanding and hearing her encouraging words had triggered something within him he felt a strong pole as stirring in his heart to break free from his self-imposed chains he began to Envision a future where he could stand tall a future where the Pains of the past did not dictate his path the desire to change was no longer a mere thought but a compelling Force driving him he longed for the warmth of a home the comfort of a steady job and the healing power of connections with others most of all he earned for self-redemption a chance to forgive himself and the opportunity to rebuild his life from your ruins at one point Dylan realized he was still dressed in a borrowed rope he jumped up looking at himself awkwardly is this your he started but Janice offered a sad smile it's okay don't worry about it Dylan sat back down once they had finished their meal he rose and began Gathering his dirty clothes sensing his discomfort Dennis told him he could use her washing machine and stay the night I'm sorry for being such a burden I don't even know how to thank you it's all right Dylan don't worry everything's okay thank you once again Dylan hesitated before asking his next question Janice may I use your computer please Dylan requests breaking the Silence of course feel free she responded gesturing towards her laptop as Dylan began clicking away on her laptop Janice sat in the living room her mind swirling with her own Tales of Sorrow she longed to unburden her heart to this stranger which shared his deepest pain with her but the words remained stuck in her throat Gathering her courage she Rose and walked over to Dylan Dylan she started her voice shaking slightly I don't want you to think less of me for letting a stranger into my home it's just my husband well I hardly know how to put it today he left for a vacation with this mistress Dylan's fingers froze above the keyboard and he turned to look at her his eyes widening in Surprise really that happened she nodded sharing a brief overview of her predicament Dylan shook his head in disbelief I thought this kind of thing only happened in movies I'm really sorry to hear that so what's your next move she sighed heavily before responding I'm gonna file for divorce but but what Dylan urged her to continue I'm just not sure he he might not be on board with the idea Dylan paused his brows furrowing before he let out a soft chuckle wait so let me get this straight your husband is off gallivanting with his mistress and you're worried he might not like the idea of a divorce the absurdity of the situation was evident but it wasn't amusing as Dylan looked into Janice's eyes he saw a hint of fear mingling with the confusion this kind innocent woman so beautiful in her Simplicity was caught in the whirlpool of emotional turmoil are you scared of him he gently asked I don't know we've been together for five years and now I just don't know what to do Dylan not as sympathetically go ahead and get some rest Janice we'll figure something out together Dylan shook his head again and turned back to the computer screen exhausted Janice decided to stretch out on the couch she was awoken by the sound of her alarm clock the next morning as she walked into the living room she realized Dylan was gone he had left a note on the side table thank you till we meet again suddenly the house felt too quiet Janice was hit by a wave of unexpected loneliness it was as if she had lost something precious she shuffled into the kitchen to make herself a coffee the subsequent two weeks passed in the blur Janice threw herself into her work staying late into the night just so she could return home exhausted and fall straight to sleep three days after Sean departed Janice mustered all her courage and started the divorce process methodically she packed up all his belongings including the Rope Dylan had worn after a shower now all she needed to do was deliver the divorce papers return his possessions and erase him from her life she changed the House locks too just for good measure this house will serve Sanctuary a place that she had inherited from her parents it was the one thing that was unquestionably hers and yet she felt a creeping unease that she might have to battle to keep it oddly enough she found her thoughts strained to Dylan more than to Sean Dylan who had appeared in her life as homeless stranger only to reveal himself as a completely different person Janice had expected to be devastated by her husband's betrayal but her heart remained quiet instead she felt a sense of relief at least she was no longer living in

ignorance fooled by a man she thought she knew it often happens that everyone else knows about the Betrayal and wives are the last to find out it can make them appear foolish in the eyes of others janus's mood only improved with her Newfound Freedom she was already envisioning herself preparing a salad and watching a romantic film enjoying a quiet evening at home one evening after work or tranquil days were interrupted as she was approaching the house she saw Sean pacing near The house's entrance likely cold from the chill she recalled having blocked his number on her phone and felt a small burst of joy that he hadn't been able to disrupt her day earlier Janice what the hell is going on what did you do to the lock and what about my phone why do I have to freeze out here Sean demanded Janice faced him calmly a slight smile gracing her lips as she spoke I've changed the lock Sean and I've blocked your number surprise was evident but it was short-lived have you lost your mind who do you think you are hand over the keys now and you go for a three-hour walk on the call see how you like it Janice calmly searched through her back causing Sean to smirk and satisfaction she realized with the jolt how accustomed she had become to his bullying tactics and how often she had let it pass in the past however instead of keys she produced a document here these are divorce papers Sean took the papers without thinking who's divorce he asked bewildered our Sean I know you didn't go to the Bahamas by yourself I saw you with her you can pick up your belongings any day just not today today I don't want to see you he took a few breaths and won everything dawned on him he surprisingly spoke quite confidently well guess what you were brought to follow me like that good wives closed their eyes on such things to save the marriage and you chose the hard path I'm a young and handsome man I'm interesting and women approach me Janice interrupted him well then you won't have to spend the night on the streets she spoke while looking at the driveway she had never seen such cars appear in their neighborhood a convoy of three large SUVs widely entered and stopped at that moment Sean grabbed her hand you're gonna do what I say you thought you could leave me just like that well you were wrong I'm gonna make your life miserable give me the keys now erased his other hand to strike Janice she closed her eyes and in the next moment realized that no one was holding her hand anymore Janice are you okay she opened her eyes it couldn't be it was Dylan's voice he was standing in front of her robbing his fist behind him Sean was struggling in the snow while a few strong guys stood between Dylan and Sean Janice smiled it's you yes it's me I was worried I wouldn't make it in time any chance you have more of those delicious meals Dylan ass to smile lighting up his eyes Janice nodded her eyes suddenly brimming with tears evidently all the pen up tension and stress had finally found a release she buried her face into Dylan's chest standing his expensive coat with tears he gently patted her back softly uttering hey hey it's okay everything's okay now Sean who was struggling to get back on his feet was a mere spectator in this emotional reunion his earlier arrogance was replaced with a stunned and shocked expression Dylan's arrival not only saved Janice from the immediate threat posed by Sean but also signaled the turning point in her life it was the moment when she finally let go of her past and took the first step towards a new and potentially happier life as for Sean who watched his whole world crumble in front of his eyes his threats fell in deaf ears and the realization of losing Janus began to sink in comfortably nestled in front of the television Janice busied herself with Brewing some fresh tea as Dylan began to reveal another part of his life that he hadn't previously shared with her the words she had imported to him about letting go of the past and forging ahead at struck a court deep within him she had unknowingly guided him towards a newfound sense of purpose and resilience once again embarking on the path of professionalism Dylan turned to his previous job to the joy and relief of his friends and colleagues but missed his presence as an agent for the Secret Service he held a unique and critical role his first order of business upon his return was to endure janus's Safety and Security establishing in protective detail to watch over her you pulled me back from the bring Janus he admitted I couldn't simply Overlook the kindness you've shown me Janice looked at him in disbelief Secret Service huh she repeated trying to comprehend the information Dylan nodded sipping his tea yes so I've been working there for years when I lost my family I lost myself too I left everything behind and spiraled into a dark place I couldn't even bring myself to reach out to my colleagues but you you reminded me that life is worth living that it's possible to start anew even when it feels like the world has ended Janice was silent stunned a multitude of emotions flashed in her eyes surprise confusion appreciation and something else Dylan couldn't quite identify after a moment she managed a small smile thank you for everything the track will silence that now envelope Janice's house was a stark contrast to the turmoil that had taken place just an hour earlier the events had unfolded so swiftly that Janus was still reeling

from them Dylan had departed without uttering any promises without giving her any clues about his next course of action yet simply thanked her and left remarkably despite Sean's Deeds Dylan had managed to find the silver lining in a tone brimming with sarcasm he thanked Sean Persian Discretions if it hadn't been for Shaw's Affair Dylan would have never crossed paths with Janus he expressed his gratitude for this unexpected yet significant beat adding another layer of complexity to today's events two days passed filled with mundane routine work and quiet evenings at home the roller coaster of emotions from a couple of days ago had begun to subside leaving Janus with an unusual sense of Tranquility mixed with curiosity mixed with curiosity about what the future held one evening after a long day at work Janus was heading back home as she walked along the familiar route she saw a figure that made her heart flutter there standing a little distance from her front gate was Dylan he stood tall on the gentle evening light his silhouette casting a long shadow on the pavement he was looking her way a smile Illuminating his face in his hands he held a bunch of flowers their vibrant colors starred contrast to the fading light of the day his appearance was significantly different from their last encounter it was well groomed and dressed neatly a far cry from the disheveled man she had first met his eyes once haunted by despair were now twinkling with hope and what seemed like happiness at that moment Janice remembered her ex-husband's father's words you my dear were never meant to settle she now understood the meaning of his words
