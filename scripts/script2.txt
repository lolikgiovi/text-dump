Title: Story: Arrogant clerk humiliates army veteran...nobody expected what followed next

foreign [Music] of the DMV office was stuffy and crowded with people who were visibly annoyed by the long wait the air conditioner in the office wasn't working properly and they were all suffering from a lack of fresh air and Fanning themselves with hats and folders a young security guard was serving the crowd with a disinterested expression noting that the people in the room seemed as though they had been there for years the same seniors migrants and dirty work clothes and nervous young mothers with crying children were all present their face is tired and worn the hallway of the DMV in this average town was not particularly interesting but the security guard's attention was drawn to the tall broad-shouldered figure of an older man in worn clothes The Man In The Faded Blue Jacket stood Out Among the crowd though his jacket was similar in style to those worn by soldiers he did not have the polished and well-groomed appearance of a Navy Warrior instead he had an unkempt and almost scary look half of his face was covered by a large burned scar in his hands which he kept hidden in his pockets were similarly disfigured he towered over the other people in the hallway looking at a place and anxious he kept glancing at his watch aware that the DMV office was closing for lunch soon the security guard had a grin on his face as he said to the man looks like you won't make it to your appointment today old man Lucy and Denise will not be sticking around any longer Lucy and Denise were middle-aged women who worked at the DMV and they were tired of dealing with the long lines of hopeful visitors they had become arrogant and only seemed to care if the visitors brought them money or expensive gifts there were also a new employee working in the office the young clerk Jennifer was different from her colleagues Lucy and Denise she was a recent graduate of an orphanage she had no significant wealth and did not accept bribes she worked diligently following the example of her beloved teacher Mrs McKenna who had taken her under her Wing like her mother Lucy and Denise were pleased to have a straight orphan working in the department that's what they call Jennifer behind her back Lucy and Denise took advantage of Jennifer's willingness to work and often left her with most of the work allowing them to relax and read magazines or go shopping during their lunch breaks and often returning late to the office they had a favored topic of conversation which was gossiping and making fun of Jennifer's appearance they did not want to acknowledge that Jennifer who was modestly and tastly dressed with minimal makeup on a fresh face was a hundred times more beautiful than they were instead of working on their own shortcomings and trying to improve themselves Lucy and Denise enjoyed spreading rumors and talking ill of Jennifer 's hard-working attitude was considered dull by Lucy and Denise her single status also became a source of ridicule earning her the nickname bird among the two women but with only 15 minutes remaining before the lunch break Lucy and Denise picked up their expensive bags with them passive expressions and left the office with dignity the man with the burned face was taken aback and said girls please don't leave I've been waiting in line since this morning Lucy and Denise ignored the man's plea and did not even bother to look at him but he persisted his voice filled with desperation please understand I came all the way from my Village my boss leaves in 20 minutes and it's the last one for today I just need to change the photo on my driver's license please Lucy replied irritably listen old man there are many of you here and there are just three of us come back after lunch break the man pleaded further please I can't come back after lunch my mother is waiting at home she has a sick heart you must understand the man tried to plead with the angry DMV clerks but they didn't listen to him Denise's face Twisted with disgust as she shouted guards get the spell out of here immediately the security guard who had been dozing off quickly woke up and followed Denise's orders he pushed the man out of the room without thinking twice he was scared of losing his job he didn't want to disappoint his wife who would leave him if he lost his job the guard pushed the man out the door and locked it with a key when Jennifer heard the commotion she ran out to see what was happening she went outside to catch up with the man but Lucy stopped her with a sneer on her face if you help every customer like that you'll never have enough time to finish all the work one person helping everyone else will just slow everyone down but Jennifer ignored them and called out to the man he turned to her with hopeful eyes when Jennifer saw the burn scar on his face she hesitated but quickly composed herself and said please come back to the office I will take care of everything and you'll make it in time for your bus as Jennifer worked on the man's paperwork he sat hunched over in a chair staring blankly at one spot he muttered is there really no justice in this world what for what for I risked my life for them Jennifer handed the completed document to the man who was still visibly upset here you go please Jennifer said as she handed the document to him and please I'm sorry for what my colleague said their work is stressful and they're burned out unfortunately this is what happens to people at the office sometimes the man with the burned scars thanked

Jennifer and wished her happiness before leaving the office an hour later Lucy and Denise came back from their lunch break and were met with angry glares from the people waiting in line someone in the crowd said insolent no words the girl is working alone while they just walk around the anger of the people was echoed by others no we can't let this go we should file a complaint someone sighed sadly what good will it do they'll just get fired and replaced by others it's better to just give them money and let them choke on it the day continued as normal in the evening Lucy and Denise laughed and mocked Jennifer we have never seen such a fool and you will be the first one that man lied to you and got help out of pity and you got tricked but the girl didn't pay attention to her colleague's words she quickly went home where her beloved cat was waiting for her Felix probably got bored and tore the wallpaper Again Jennifer thought with a smile happily tapping her heels on the pavement a few days later the authorities paid a visit to the DMV the guard perked up when he saw the city mayor Mr reckenzone getting out of his expensive SUV with his Entourage Mitchell reckonsone confidently marched down the narrow Corridor and firmly grasped the door handle when he heard busy no need to roam around without a call he flown the door open to the office Lucy and Denise were frozen in place unable to speak their coffee mugs trembled in their ringed hands Jennifer looked on with interest as the formidable boss exclaimed what kind of nonsense is going on here the mayor continued the other day an honorable resident of our city and war hero Chris Dober came here and you humiliated him Lucy and Denise tried to defend themselves batting their eyelashes but the mayor didn't even want to listen it turns out that the hero missed the bus after all desperate he decided to walk with the hope of catching a ride an expensive SUV stopped in front of Chris the driver was the mayor himself who recognized The Honorable Citizen and felt it was his duty to take him to his destination Chris Dober a Submariner midshipman served in a nuclear submarine for a long time one day a terrible fire broke out on the ship threatening to turn into a large-scale disaster that could destroy dozens of human lives and cause irreparable damage to the environment after putting out the fire Mr Dober received severe burns and became disabled Chris was discharged from the service and sent home for a well-deserved rest but in his hometown new troubles awaited him his wife seeing the condition he was in quickly packed her suitcase and left him later Chris found out that his ex-wife was having an affair with a small Market Trader after that she was seen with another guy and then another an unemployed drunker Mr Doper went to his village to lift with his elderly mother and led a solitary life he started drinking but did not lose control he helped his mother with housework completely forgetting to take care of his appearance he forgot that many people still judge a person by their clothes so he came to the DMV office in shabby clothes that made him feel comfortable in the village the inhabitants had long known and gotten used to his old midshipman's pee jacket and the scars on his face after the mayor paid a visit both Lucy and Denise were let go and Jennifer was given the role of head of the DMV office although the position came with added responsibilities and concerns Jennifer embraced The Challenge and made an effort to treat customers with kindness she assembled a young team and the DMV began operating efficiently as a result customers no longer had to wait in long lines and the employees received positive feedback from satisfied visitors Jennifer's personal life also took a turn for the better when she met a Charming Man Who worked as a camera operator for a local television station the journalists visited the DMV to film a story about Jennifer and her profession and the young operator was taken with Jennifer's friendly and open demeanor they went on a walk together after work and soon after he invited her to the movies a month later Jennifer and her new boyfriend Greg became Inseparable in her cat who had previously been destructive due to Borden stopped tearing up the wallpaper as he was content with the new Love in the household on Memorial Day Jennifer and her friends including Bragg who was filming a story for the evening news attended a gathering together Jennifer was invited as a guest of honor being recognized as the best social worker while on the stage she saw a distinguished man in full dress uniform the sailor's chest was adorned with medals and decorations Jennifer recognized the man as Chris stober a brave hero the side of him made her heart race with pride today the hero gave a heartfelt speech to the residents he shared his life story and spoke about his deeds modestly noting that he fulfilled his duties and served this country not for the sake of receiving medals the most important thing is to be human not everyone can put themselves In Harm's Way or sacrifice themselves for others for me the epitome of honesty and integrity was a kind and lovely girl who reached out to me when everyone else had turned away as Jennifer heard her name being cold she saw the hero extending an invitation for her to come up to the podium with the help of others she climbed up onto a tall platform the entire city erupted an Applause as the honorary citizen presented her with a beautiful bouquet of lush

roses Greg captured the moment on camera and in the evening while watching the news he excitedly told Jennifer that she should have no doubt about his sincere and true love for her why Jennifer asked look how beautiful you are on the screen just like a movie star here replied they say that the camera loves a person meaning the operator is infatuated with the person they captured Jennifer laughed and said Greg you scoundrel on the screen I may look like a movie star but in real life I'm a plain Jane huh Greg hugged his beloved looked into her eyes and said quietly in life you are a hundred times more beautiful what are your thoughts on the story and characters how would you handle things differently share your thoughts as they may be helpful for those experiencing difficult times if you enjoyed the story please consider liking and subscribing for more content click the notification Bell button thank you and we'll see you soon
